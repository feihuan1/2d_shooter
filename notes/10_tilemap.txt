We want decorate the level with images! 

the easiest way is to simply place Sprites. you can modify things substantially by changing the color and scale values

repeat image
region -> select -> testure -> repeat -> enabled

change color
visibility -> modulate(be inheritated with children) -> self modulate(not inherable)

for complex setups, you want use a Tilemap!

Tile -> a single graphic 
Tileset -> a combination of tiles 
Tilemap -> a godot Node that organizes tilesets(can contain signle or multiple tilesets)

tilemap can have multiple layer!!!
