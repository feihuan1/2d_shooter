We can animate any property using an AnimationPlayer
but sometimes we just want a simple animation 
(zooming in with a camera, updating the postion, hcanging the transparency) 
Having an animationPlayer for that is overkill 
For thay, we have tweens!!!

Tweens are not a node(used to be earlier versions) 

They are an object you create in the script of a node 
and then this tween object can interpolate between 2 values 

for example: rotation 

start: 0, End: 100, Duration: 1s

	var tween = get_tree().create_tween() or var tween = create_tween()
	tween.tween_property($Player/Camera2D, "zoom", Vector2(1, 1), 1)
