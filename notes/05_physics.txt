Problem
currently, we are moving images only 
images cannot collide or silide along surfaces 
they dont have physical propertyies 
Solution: Collisions & PhysicsBodies!!

Area2D: an area that can check if another body entered | Can be moved by changing the position
		Check if player entered a house, laser will be areas too
		
StaticBody2D: a static body that other bodies collide with | Not supposed to be moved 
				Any static object: wall, beds, obstacles...
				
RigidBody2D: Moving body that moves via physics(like a cannonball) | Set a initial velocity 
				the grenade
				
CharacterBody2D: Moving body controlled by code | Inbuild methods 
					Any entity that controlled by code: The play & all enemies
					when working with CharacterBody2D, use move_and_slide instead of position
					set velocity and move_and_slide will auto pick it up
					it automaticly includes delta
					

CollisionPolygon2D: custom shape
CllisionShape2D: fixed shape
