Every CollisionObject has a collision layer 

you can place objects on layers to make them interact with objects on other layers

this is dont with layer and mask 

"layer" determines on witch layer the object itself is 

"Mask" determines which layers it can interact with 
exp: 
	Layers: Player, Enemies, Objects, Projectiles, Items and Zones 
		the Player scene is on the Player layer and the mask can interact with all other layers
		each Enemy scene will be on the enemies layer and the mask will be for the player, object and the projectiles, Not OTHER ENEMIES or ITEM & ZONES 
		set physics layer name in project setting

-- Tilemap
	inspector -> tileset -> paint -> click image -> draw colision shape
	(click three dot above editor, select flip for faster development)
	draw area with gap can lead to stucking bug in game, be very precise please!!!
