			you can create your own signals 
the major limitation of signals is that they only work between nodes in the same scene
1. define a signal using signal keywork like var in child scene (signal player_enter)
2. connect a signal with any type and emit the custom signal inside the signal function (player_enter.emit())
3. in parent scene, the child scene will have a custom signal under script,
4, write the function about what u want do with it
