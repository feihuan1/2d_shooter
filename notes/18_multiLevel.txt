We mostly reuse the Tilemap to build the 2nd level 
The only thing to cover is how to use a tileset across multiple tilemaps
(so we dont have to re-draw shapes)

go to any scene has the tilemap -> click dropdown in tileset at inspector-> save as 
go to the scene want use the tileset, drap the saved tile set in tileset at inspector
