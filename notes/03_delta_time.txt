delta is always come with _process function

the movement speed of our game is determined by how fast the game runs(how many frames are generated)
slow computer and fast computer have a huge diference on this, this is a massive problem!!!

speeds(pixels per frame)         frame per second              total movement(per second)
10px                                   30                           10*30 = 300
10px								   60							60*10 = 300
10px								   120							120*10 = 1200

speed of movement will be huge diference base on computer frame rate
including charactor speed, enemy movements ...., its like cheat code enabled

the game will run inconsistently on diferent systems 
since some scene are harder(bigger map) to render than others, it might even run inconsistently on same system!!!

				solution: Delta time
delta time measures how long it took to create one frame 
for exp: if the framerate is 60 fps, 
delta time is 1s/60 = 0.0167s 
this infomation we can use to keep the same at a constant speed regardless of framerate 
We just need multiply any movement with delta time


speeds		    frame per second    Delta time    original movement  Delta movements
(pixels/frame)						(seconds)	    (per second)	 (per second)
10px            30                  1/30=0.033     10*30 = 300		 10*30*0.033= 10
10px			60					1/60=0.017	   60*10 = 300		 10*60*0.017= 10
10px			120					1/120=0.008    120*10 = 1200	 10*120*0.008= 10

with delta accounted, the game runs at same speed at any framerate!
Problem solved!!!
