There are 4 kinds of Nodes 
2D - BLUE
3D - RED 
Control - green 
other - white

UI -> Control Nodes 
lables, images, progress bars, buttons, area with colors, text input, graphs, menu, videos

!!!!!!!
2D nodes are places via pexel positions, 
Control Nodes work via anchors and container

diference between a textureRect and a sprite2D is TextureRect has anchor!!!

!!!!!!!!!!!
CanvasLayer will follow the camera, stick to the user screen

There are two way to place a control node 

Anchor and cotainers 

Anchors are the green needles in the topleft of a control node

Containers are parent node that determine the position of their children

(you can also use x and y properties or drag the Control node to the position you want but thay is almost never a good idea)
-> thats the absolute position, if resize the screen, if stays the same position absolute based on how many pixels from x and y , this break the UI
