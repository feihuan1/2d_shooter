problems!
Using an area2D right now is pointless: we just have an invisible area
we need functionality so that his area actully does something
for that we need signals

Signals!
when a certain action happens to a node: a body entering an area, a timer running out, 2 bodies colliding
you can tell the affected node to send a signal,witch basically means you are runing a function
this is incredibly powerful to make nodes communicate with each other!
