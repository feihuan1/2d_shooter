problems!
Using an area2D right now is pointless: we just have an invisible area
we need functionality so that his area actully does something
for that we need signals

Signals!
when a certain action happens to a node: a body entering an area, a timer running out, 2 bodies colliding
you can tell the affected node to send a signal,witch basically means you are runing a function
this is incredibly powerful to make nodes communicate with each other!

			you can create your own signals 
the major limitation of signals is that they only work between nodes in the same scene
1. define a signal using signal keywork like var in child scene (signal player_enter)
2. connect a signal with any type and emit the custom signal inside the signal function (player_enter.emit())
3. in parent scene, the child scene will have a custom signal under script,
4, write the function about what u want do with it
