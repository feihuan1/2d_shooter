Make the Scout light up 

if the scout (or the player) is hit there will be a change in health

But that isn't communicated so the player wouldn't know what is happenning

so we want to make the scout flash for a short time after being hit 

for that we will need a new topic: Shaders!

shaders determine how elements are displayed in the game

	Resource(original inage)  -> game
			godot logo			can display exact same imafe
								Display every pixel as white(get a white squar of image)
								Display every pixel as white and keep original alpha values
								(get a white rounded corner image)
		
		shader can change in real time: 
			the color of a pixel 
			the transparency of a pixel 
			the position of a pixel
		
you can also change value dynamically to create movement or color changes
		
shaders are advanced
We are not using GDScript 
Godot has a C-like shading language 
you must be strict with datatypes 
add semicolons after every line 

Since we run code for every pixel of a graphic
we dont get something like print, This makes debugging much harder.

on sprite2D -> inspector -> canvasItem -> Material -> new shader meterial -> click on box -> new shader

avoid if statement, bad performence!!! 

uniform make variable in gdshader accessable in gdScript
