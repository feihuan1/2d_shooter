You just have to create more level scenes 
but it is not that easy

our level contains quite a bit of code. if we created other level scenes this logic would not be available
we could copy it but that would be very inefficient

instead we use 		Inheritance
we want create a parent level scene that contains all the logic
all other level scenes inherit from that 

go to top left scene -> new inherited scene -> choose a scene

what ever changed in parent, the child will change too 
yellow nodes in Scene tree means its been inherited from parent

also you might want inherite script
in parent script, create class name className LevelParent 
in child, instead extends Node2D, extends LevelParent

need reconnect single!
