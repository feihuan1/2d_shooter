To change the level we need to load another scene 
This is trivial in Godot 
But the transition will be a hard cut(instant change)
	get_tree().change_scene_to_file("res://scenes/levels/outside.tscn")
						or 
	var outside_level_scene: PackedScene = preload("res://scenes/levels/outside.tscn")
	get_tree().change_scene_to_packed(outside_level_scene)
second approach can use @export make it easier to choose multiple exit of map
We need use an AnimationPlayer to add a proper transition
