Currently, we are updating the player stats and then update the UI 

but this is getting complex fast(cross scene, signals)

What would be much better is to have some code that updates the UI automatically once any player stat changes(from Globals)

Set Get: 
	it allows us to run code whenever the value of a variable changed or accessed 
	for exp: whenever the health of the player changes we want to update the UI from the Globals
