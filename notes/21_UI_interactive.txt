when the player is shooting a laser we want to reduce the laser by 1

this means we need a laser variable in 2 scenes: the player and the UI 

for more complex game we might even want it in more scenes (upgrade menu, store) 

hence, laser and grenades need to be accessible everywhere

					Autoload 
it automatically loads a scene or a script into every single scene 
that wa you can store and access infomation globally 

we will use that for the laser and grenade 

later on this will also store the player position
