the laser should disappear when colliding with a wall/object 
if it collides with an enemy it should rigger a function 

finnally, it should disappear after a certain amount of time (queue_free())
that way, we cannot have infinite laser

if(body.has_method("hit")):
		body.hit()
	or
if "hit" in body: 
	body.hit()
use has_method t check if a node has this func(use on enemy)
