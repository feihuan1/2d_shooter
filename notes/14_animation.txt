Animation work by playing images in sequens
	but images can be 2 format: 
				as separate images or in a spritesheet

Godot can cover both 
separate images: AnimatedSprite2D 
spritesheet: Srite2D(it has an animation tab)


			AnimationPlayer 
it plays an animation 
By animation we mean any kind of change in property 
(move, rotation, animation frames, light energy etc) 

you can also call methods 
and you get alot of control over these changes
