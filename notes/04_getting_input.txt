two step to get input
1. create an input map(happen in project setting)
	this look for possible inputs and makes them accessible in the gamr 
	for exp: we can get left key and "A" key and joy-stick left store them all under left key 	in the input map
step: project on top bar -> project setting -> input map ->add new action -> type a name -> bind a key by press keyboard
	
2. access the input (happen in code)
	Godot has an Input object that can check various inputs
